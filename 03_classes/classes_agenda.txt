About Class concept in TypeScript
---------------------------------
We'll be using classes for writing services (getting data from the backend & displaying in the frontend), components.
Business logics will be defined into the classes.

1. Introduction to Class in TS
2. Class properties
    # Types of declaring class-properties
3. Default & parameterized constructors
4. Class methods: It doesn't require to define the "function" keyword explicitly inside of the Class
5. Creating instance of Class
6. Member visibility (incld. INHERITANCE, METHOD OVERRIDING, STATIC METHOD, GETTER-SETTER METHOD)
7. Static members
8. ALternative of "import" statements. (import module from another location)
