Procedure
---------
1. Initialize 'package.json' file using the cmd. It'll keep track of all the packages which will be installed & used in the workspace. (It's like a 'requirements.txt' file in terms of npm) [ npm init ]
2. Install typescript inside the node_modules. It'll initialize "node_modules" containing typescript-packages.  
    [ npm i typescript ]
3. Initialize typescript-configuration file. It'll provide "tsconfig.json" file.  [ npm tsc --init ]


Compile TpeScript Code
----------------------
1. To compile a typescript file, use the cmd.  [ npx tsc fileName.ts ]
   After compilation, it'll provide a compiled javaScript file. To compile into a specific directory, use the following output.
    [ npx tsc fileName.ts --outDir DIRECTORY/ ]
   In case of this current file structure, use this CMD:  [ npx tsc fileName.ts --outDir ../compiled/x_topicDir/ ]
2. Use "node" to run the compiled javaScript file.  [ node fileName.js ]
