--------------------
1. Introduction to Decorators: Used to modify the behavior of a class / method / property at runtime.
2. Class Decorators
3. Method Decorators

** Brief observation on "tsconfig.json" file.
- "outDir": Flag to emit compiled files into user-defined directory location.
- "sourceMap": Flag used by the browser to redirect the user to TS file rather than the JS file while a error occur.

NB: Nothing is done in the YT Video Tutorial.
