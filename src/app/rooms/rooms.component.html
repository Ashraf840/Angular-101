<h3>Angular Built-in Directives</h3>
<p>Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications.
    Use Angular's built-in directives to manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see.</p>
<ul>
    <b>
        <b>Structural Directives:
            <span>These can add/remove your DOM Elements!</span>
        </b>
        <li>*ngIf</li>
        <li>*ngFor</li>
        <li>*ngSwitch --- *ngSwitchCase</li>
        <small>The "*" as a prefix will distinguish the structural directives from the attribute directives</small>
        <hr>
        <b>Attribute Directives:
            <span>Probably add/remove attributes from your DOM Elements!</span>
        </b>
        <li>ngClass: related to css styling</li>
        <li>ngStyle: related to css styling</li>
        <li>ngModel</li>

<h3>Nullish Coalescing & Optional Chaining</h3>

<p>
    Nullish Coalescing: Before accessing the property of an object, firstly check if that exist or not. <br />
    No. of available rooms: {{ room.avaiableRooms ?? "No Rooms" }}
</p>


<br />
<p>
    Optional Chaining: Won't show room list, if the room object doesn't contain any property yet.
</p>
<p>Already know how to bind string, number, boolean and objects. Not bind arrays using structural directives "*ngFor".

<h3>Lifecycle Hooks
    <span>
        <h5>(parallely Component Communication)</h5>
    </span>
</h3>
<p>Lifecycle hooks are a special functionality (method) in Angular that allow us to “<b>hook into</b>” and run code at a
    specific lifecycle event of a component or directive. Angular manages components and directives for us when it
    creates them, updates them, or destroys them. <br>
    The following lifecycle hooks will always <b>maintains the order</b> as they are defined below.
    Other than the following lifecycle hooks, "constructor" is the one which will be first called while each component
    gets initialized.</p>
<ul>
    <b>
        <li>ngOnChange:
            <small>(Change detection) By default, changes in any component (both parent & child) will send an event to
                the root component & that will start running change detection to each & every component. There are some
                rules before applying chage-detection strategy to the components (child). Add "changeDetection" property
                to the "Component" decorator. It'll detect any changes to your input values. The property has 2
                strategies: "Default" & "OnPush"
                <ul>
                    <li>Default: It's implied by default. Any event will cause to run change detection for the
                        application, when the 'changeDetectionStrategy' is set to "Default".</li>
                    <li>OnPush: This change detection strategy can only be applied in case no data is getting modified
                        internally in that specified component. This startegy is also applicable to any
                        state-management-technique. <br>
                        Here, we'll use this strategy in the "rooms-list" component. Since this component relies on data
                        coming from outside, also it doen't change the data internally. <br>
                        N.B: While working with this strategy, the data which is about to be assigned into the
                        child-component needs to be immutable. Thus rather than modifying the "roomList" array using
                        push, return a new object everytime we modify the instance. Implement the ngOnChange lifecycle
                        hook into "room-list" component.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Prerequisites: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The targeted component should not change the data internally.</li>
                    <li>In case of assigning/passing some data, it should come from the parent component.</li>
                    <li>The property should be immutable. In case of passing of data to the child component, while this
                        strategy is applied on that child component, pass a new instance everytime.</li>
                    <li>"ngOnChange" will only work in case the component has @Input property & if that gets new value.
                        Then you'll get some data regarding the change on this lifecycle hook. General properties of
                        this hook as passed as an param ("changes") are: "currentValue", "firstChange", "previousValue".
                        Based on this we can write custom logic as per our requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                Concepts Learned in this lifecycle hook:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Component communication by passing data using @Input & @Output</li>
                    <li>Change detection strategy: Default & OnPush</li>
                </ul>
            </small>
        </li> <br>
        <li>ngOnInit:
            <small>Just after the constructor initializes the component, "ngOnInit" lifecycle will be invoked. All the
                logic should be written here, the constructor should be used only when we want to inject some services.
                It's the initialization of the component.</small>
        </li> <br>
        <li>ngDoCheck:
            <small>This lifecyle hook is hardly used. This lifecycle hooks gets invoked everytime whenever any event is
                raised anywhere in the entire application, irrespective of where this component is implmented of
                available. It's more like a radar/signals (in python-dj). THUS THIS LIFECYCLE HOOK IS VERY COSTLY. <br>
                NB: DON'T IMPLEMENT "ngOnChange" & "ngDoCheck" HOOKS TOGETHER IN THE SAME COMPONENT. TRY TO AVOID THIS
                HOOK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
                Use Cases:
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the logout button, which is placed some corner of your screen. Capture that event by this
                        hook & Implement logic as required.</li>
                </ul>
            </small>
        </li> <br>
        <li>ngAfterContentInit:
            <small>
                While the contents are being initialized completely in the parent component ("app") meant to pass to the
                "container" component, then we can access & modify the content inside the "ngAfterContentInit" lifecycle
                of the container-component.
                <br>
                Prerequisites: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content Projection: </li>
                    <li>"ng-content" Tag (Container Component): While we want to insert content dynamically inside a
                        component, then we use the "ng-content" tag, which will later replaced by the contents while
                        Angular parses that content into the parent component. <br>
                        By using "ng-content", we can define the sequence in which we want to load our components. <br>
                        The "ng-content" can create container components which can be a reuseable component accross
                        mulitple application in the Angular project. <br>
                        NB: "employee" component is created, so that we can demonstrate the sequence of components
                        loading through the "container" component. The sequence will be defined in the container
                        component's template. After defining the sequence inside the container-component's template,
                        we've to pass the template-tag of the desired components which are defined in the
                        container-component's template regardless of the defined sequence. <br>
                        <span style="color:rgb(63, 236, 40);">Sequence of Component Loading</span>: &nbsp;&nbsp;
                        "employee" -> "container" -> "rooms"
                    </li>
                    <li>@ContentChild decorator: We can access & modify any of the content which is passed to the
                        "ng-content" of the container from the parent component. Although it doesn't have any such
                        property called "static=true", since the components which will be passed as content to the
                        container-component required to be loaded first.</li>
                </ul>
            </small>
        </li> <br>
        <li>ngAfterContentChecked</li> <br>
        <li>ngAfterViewInit:
            <small>
                In this lifecycle hook, the component of itself is denoting the view that it contains is also
                initialized. Thus, if I try to load any other component into this component, it's ready to load that as
                well. Simply It'll load other component only after the template of this parent component is initialized.
                <br>
                <span class="text-danger">NB:</span> This "rooms" component is new dynamically rendered by the
                combination of @ViewChild decorator & "ngAfterViewInit" lifecycle hook from the main "app" component.
                <br>
                Prerequisites: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>@ViewChild: We can communicate / load a component by using "ViewChild" decorator into another
                        component. <br>
                        Procedure of using @ViewChild: Create a new separate component "header" in the "src\app" dir &
                        communicate to that using "ViewChild". <br>
                        Use properties of that separate component ("header") into another component ("rooms") using
                        "@ViewChild" decorator. <br>
                        But here's the catch, immediately after getting the properties of that other component using
                        @ViewChild, we cannot access its properties, unless we use the "ngAfterViewInit" lifecycle hook.
                        Inside that interface we can access all the properties of that other component ("header"). <br>
                        By default the "static" property is false in this decorator. But by using static=true, we can
                        load the other component into this component's "ngOnInit" hook while they are also available
                        into "ngAfterViewInit" hook. <br>
                        NB: ONLY USE STATIC=TRUE IF THE OTHER COMPONENT DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY ASYNCHRONOUS CODE INTO IT'S
                        "ngOnInit" hook. <br>
                        static=true denotes that the component is safe to be used on the "ngOnInit" hook of it's parent
                        component.
                        Thus, it's always safe to use static=false & load the othe component into the parent component's
                        "ngAfterViewInit" lifecycle hook. <br>
                        NB:
                        <ul>
                            <li>CAN LOAD COMPONENTS DYNAMICALLY WITHOUT SPECIFYING THEM IN THE TEMPLATE.</li>
                            <li>@ViewChild CAN ONLY ACCESS THE FIRST INSTANCE AVAILABLE IN THE HTML TEMPLATE.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>@ViewChildren: In case we've more than one instance in the template use this decorator. This
                        decorator's "static" property is by default false & YOU CANNOT CHANGE IT, unlikely to the
                        @ViewChild decorator, where your are able to change the "static" property. </li>
                </ul> <br>
                Concepts Learned in this lifecycle hook:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access separate components using @ViewChild & load-modify them into another component.</li>
                    <li>Dynamically Loaded Component: Components can be dynamically loaded using @ViewChild decorator,
                        but required to load it inside the "ngAfterViewInit" hook. Which means, we don't need to define
                        the component-tag into the template in a hard-coded manner.</li>
                    <li>Modify the property of dynamically loaded component using @ViewChild. For this, "template
                        reference" is used.</li>
                    <li>"ng-template" (Angular elem): It's an Angular element that is used for rendering HTML in a
                        template. However, it is not rendered directly on DOM, or it won't render anything itself, but
                        it can help us to render some other template (component). If you include an ng-template tag to a
                        template, the tag and the content inside it will be replaced by comment upon render. We can get
                        access to the "ng-template" tag into the ".ts" file using "template reference" (#hashtag-name)<a

                <ul>
                    <li>If there is a memory consuming code that I want to release while destroying the component, this
                        hook then comes in handy.</li>
                    <li>Can remove something from local/session storage while a component is getting destroyed.</li>

<h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
<p>
    Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. That enables you to replace dependencies without changing the class that uses them. <br>
    
    <b>Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself.</b> <br>
    
    It's a very useful technique for testing, since it allows dependencies to be mocked or stubbed out. <br>
    Angular has a built-in Dependency Injection support. <br>

    Use the cmd to create a service:  <br>
    <i>ng g s serviceName</i> <br>
    <i>ng generate service serviceName</i>
</p>

<h5>DI Providers</h5>
<ul>
    <b>
        <li>Class based providers</li>
        <li>Value Providers</li>
        <li>Factory</li>
    </b>
</ul>

<h5>Concept (DOs & DON'Ts)</h5>
<p>Create <b>services</b> & move all the re-useable code to that service. Keep minimum amount of code inside your component. Services should contain all the business logics. Each component should contain a manually created "services" dir which should contain the services for Dependency Injection. <br><br>

<b>You'd not create an instance of a service directly into "component.ts" file while implementing DI, since Dependency Injection is provided by default from Angular, inject the service into the "constructor" of that particular component. But keep the injection "private" in the constructor, thus the service is not leaked into the HTML template.</b> <br><br>

Generally, your component should not know how to get/add/delete the data or how to perform any business logic, these are the responsibilities of a service. <br>

Until Angular 6, devs have to register each services into the "<b>providers</b>" property of the "<b>app.module</b>", which used to be a tidous task to remove those services from that (<i>"provides" from "app.module" file</i>) if the services are no logner used in the project. Thus the unused services where bundled in the build package prior to deployment. Thus the Angular Team decided to handle the registration/un-registration of services through the "<b>providedIn: root</b>" property of the "<b>@Injectable</b>" decorator from the next release of Angular versions.
</p>

<h5>Usage of Services</h5>
<ul>
    <b>
        <li>Sharing data between multiple components</li>
        <li>Sharing data within App</li>
        <li>It abides by the "Singleton" pattern. Means, I don't have to re-create an instance of this service whenever I need to use this service. A single instance is always initialized by the "@Injectable" decorator by registering that service into the root-module.</li>
        <li>In case of needing separate instance of the service for other components, we can pass the service through "providers" property of the "@Component" decorator of that component.</li>
    </b>
</ul>

<h5>Dependency Resolution</h5>
<p>When an depenecy injection is performed into a component, Angular starts search for the service into from the path: <br>
    <b>
        root-module (root moduleInjector) -> moduleInjector (platformModule) -> NullInjector (always throws NullInjectorError unless we use "@Optional()"
    </b>
</p>


<h5>Resolution Modifiers</h5>
<ul>
    <b>
        <li>Self: When a service is injected at the component-level & we use the "Self()" DI resolution modifier, if the service is not registered inside the "providers" property of that component level, then it'll throw an error/exception.</li>
        <li>SkipSelf</li>
        <li>Optional</li>
        <li>Host</li>
    </b>
</ul>
